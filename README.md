# Capture-and-Analyze-Network-Traffic-Using-Wireshark-on-Windows

## ðŸ“„ Overview
This project involves the capture, analysis, and interpretation of network traffic using **Wireshark**, with a focus on identifying and examining common network protocols over a **Wi-Fi connection**. The report is structured to present objectives, tools used, methodology, protocol details, packet structures, observations, and final conclusions.

The goal is to enhance practical knowledge of network communication, packet structures, and protocol interactions while maintaining ethical standards and privacy compliance.
